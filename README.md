#iOS Developer Test Task

##Onboarding Screens

**Requirements:**

- Use Swift and UIKit
- All changes must be committed to Git
- Not allowed to use any frameworks (except RxSwift or Combine).
- Allowed to use any project architecture
- RxSwift / Combine is optional, but will be a plus.

**Description**

- The task is to develop 4 onboarding screens, similar to those in our Assist application (https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/assist-chat-with-ai/id6448989090).

- The code should also demonstrate payment processing (it's okay if there is no access to the Apple Developer Program, as only the code, not the actual payment processing, will be evaluated).

- Parts of the code that require a backend should be mocked (return the expected backend result hardcoded).*
